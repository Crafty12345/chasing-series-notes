# Unconfirmed Ideas
- ~~[Red-Haired Girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md) (red-haired girl) is a ghost who is permadead
	- [Zelda](Zelda%20Appel.md) and Zelda's dad are the last people in the world to remember [Red-Haired Girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md)~~
- Zelda's dad is really rich
	- Almost everyone at Zelda's school in Germany were actors who were paid to be mean to her, in hopes that she'd kill herself
		- Zelda's dad figured this would be easier than killing Zelda himself
		- The paid actors were used as vessels by Zelda's dad, allowing him to switch bodies while in the Lower Afterlife and not get caught
	- Zelda's dad wants to kill her because he knows she is a ruin and is worried she'd have the power and knowledge required to stop his plan
	- **Zelda's dad's plan**:
		- He plans to use [Freya's](Red-Haired%20Girl.md) power to move him and his ex-ex-wife (wife before [[Gunda Appel|Gunda]]) from the lower afterlife to the upper afterlife
