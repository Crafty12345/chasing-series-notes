#ruin 
- Can talk to people in photos and recognise who they are
- If a photo is torn, the [Generational Ruin](Generational%20Ruin.md) will have trouble recognising the person in the photo
	- Even if a photo is taped back together with clear sticky tape, the [Generational Ruin's](Generational%20Ruin.md) recognition won't work
- If you show the [Generational Ruin](Generational%20Ruin.md) a photo of a person they've met in another photo but don't tell them they've already met them, they can figure that out on their own
