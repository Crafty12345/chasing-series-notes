- When people become ghosts, they cannot die of natural causes
	- Instead, they must be fully forgotten, with all memorabilia of them lost, causing [Permadeath](#Permadeath)

# Ghost Death
- Ghosts can't die naturally once they're ghosts, for a ghost to permanently die they need to be killed as a ghost the same way they were killed as a living human

# Permadeath

- Caused by a ghost being fully forgotten about, with all memorabilia of when they were alive gone
- If a ghost ["dies"](#Ghost%20Death), people's memories of them will slowly vanish, until they are eventually forgotten about

# Haunting
- If a ghost is haunting someone at the time of that person's death, relatives of the person who just died are able to see that ghost when they take the spirit of the person who just died to the afterlife
	- Non-relatives can only sense the ghost's presence
	- Close friends can also see the ghost transporting the spirit
- If an upper afterlife ghost haunts someone who goes on to also become an upper afterlife ghost, the original upper afterlife ghost will be the one to transport the person who just died to the afterlife
- If there are multiple ghosts in a room but only one is there with the purpose of visiting the dying person, then that ghost will be prioritised as the one to transport their spirit to the afterlife
	- It is a grey area if all ghosts are haunting the person who just died at the same time. If this happens, the first two ghosts to arrive will transport the spirit and the other two will come along to help the spirit adjust
- If haunting by a ghost is done to directly kill a person, then that person's spirit will go to the afterlife by themself
	- The afterlife guards would usually decide that the killer ghost is unfit to travel with the new spirit, since they worry that the killer ghost will negatively influence the new spirit
