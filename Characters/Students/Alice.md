# History
Alice was born in [Australia](Australia) in 2006. When she was young, she always felt out-of-place and like she didn't fit in anywhere.

When Alice started high school at [Kalamunda Sapling School](<Kalamunda Sapling School>) in 2018, she began to notice that she got along with girls better than boys, and that she just generally liked them more.

As Alice grew older into her high school years, she progressively noticed that she became less like the boys and more like the girls, and, without realising it, started to feel gender dysphoria for the first time. Additionally, she started using more social media, and learned that there were people in the world who changed their gender. Knowing this gave her the realisation that she could do this, too, and she felt validated.

As Alice's feelings of gender dysphoria became stronger, she discovered her powers for the first time - when she began trying on more feminine clothes with her aunty, she not only gained more self-confidence, but her physical appearance and body also changed to become more feminine.

This added self-confidence and changing body that occurred when Alice presented herself more femininely reassured her that she was definitely a woman. This led her to, in 2021, start describing her as "Alice", instead of "Alex", and use feminine pronouns (she/her) online, around her aunty, and around *some* classmates and teachers. It is important to note that she was not yet comfortable coming out to everybody.

## Current Day
Now, Alice is out to many more people, thanks to the affirmation she gets from [Fiadh](<Fiadh Gallagher>) and her friends. She currently hopes to find love some day, but being transgender has made it difficult for her to find romantic love.

Alice is still attending [[Kalamunda Sapling School]] and is currently doing the following subjects:
### Math General

### English

### Art
Alice is in [[Harper Belanger|Harper]]'s art class and frequently enjoys painting her, in abnormally high detail. She is also in [Altair](<Altair Vilar-Castelo>) and [Fernanda](<Fernanda Grillo>)'s art class.

### Photography

### Media
Alice is in [[Ash]] and [[Harper Belanger|Harper]]'s media class, in which they are all currently doing a group project together.

### Geography
Alice is currently in [[Zelda Appel|Zelda]]'s geography class. It was in this class that they organised to go shopping together for the first time.

# Relationships

## Harper
Alice has a crush on [[Harper Belanger|Harper]], however she is in a very tough situation because [[Harper Belanger|Harper]] actually has a one-sided crush on [Ash](Ash).

## Fiadh
Alice approached [Fiadh](<Fiadh Gallagher>) in Chapter 13, requiring love advice relating to her crush on [[Harper Belanger|Harper]]. Having no other friends at the time, Alice decides to use this as a chance to join the group, especially since [Harper](<Harper Belanger>) was in the group, anyways. Unexpectedly, this led to Alice becoming great friends with [Fiadh](<Fiadh Gallagher>).

## Ash
Because [Ash](Ash) is non-binary, and therefore, also transgender, he felt an instant connection with Alice once they saw her. Now, Ash acts very protective over Alice.

## Zelda
[Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) is Alice's best friend. They met through their connection with [Fiadh](<Fiadh Gallagher>), however things really kicked off when they decided to talk to each other during geography class, in Chapter 14, and the two of them agreed to go shopping at a Belmont shopping centre together.
