# History
Fiadh (pronounced "fee-ah") was born in Australia, in April of 2006. Her mum, [Sorcha](Sorcha%20Gallagher), is Irish and her dad, [Chris](Christopher%20Gallagher), is Australian. Since [Sorcha](Sorcha%20Gallagher) is a zoologist, Fiadh looks up to her.

Fiadh, for her whole life, has had a strong connection to nature, even stronger than her mum's, and so much so that she gained the powers to talk to plants and animals, which has become a large element of her personality. 

Throughout her life in primary school, Fiadh experienced a large amount of indirect bullying. People would frequently look at her weird because she'd show up to school with mud on her face, or she'd start talking to strands of grass.

Fiadh soon became great friends with the teachers at her primary school, and she began to start keeping note of the names of the people being mean to her, and would rattle off this extensive list to the teachers, though little would get done about it due to Fiadh's bad pronunciation of people's names.

It is important to note that, whilst Fiadh didn't have any friends in her year yet, she enjoyed talking to Mila's friends, especially [Miranda](Miranda%20Jenkins) and [Victoria](Victoria%20Pearce).

When Fiadh started in high school, at [Kalamunda Sapling School](Kalamunda%20Sapling%20School), things got significantly better - people at this school were much kinder, and did not bully her. Still having no friends, however, she began to make friends with the teachers at this school as well.

When [Zelda](Zelda%20Appel) arrived at the school, things changed for Fiadh. Fiadh was incredibly excited to get to know [Zelda](Zelda%20Appel), and [Zelda](Zelda%20Appel) finally became the first friend that was in her year.
