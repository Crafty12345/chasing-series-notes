# History
She was born in Antwerp, and, for the first few years of her life, was raised by both her mother and father. She was a curious child, often looking at old photos in the house and asking questions about them. During her early years, her father worked and her mother was a D List actress, so for the most part, she hung around both her grandparents. Every weekend, she would head to a nursing home in North Holland to visit her great-grandmother.

Oftentimes, her great-grandmother (whose name was Jacomijntje) would take her out to art galleries. She would often tell Myrthe exactly what the people in the paintings were like, and the little Myrthe would listen with great interest. 

Myrthe discovers her powers by accident when she is four years old. When her mother died, she often looked at photos of her to remember her, trying to figure out where she disappeared to and what happened. When she touched the edge of her mother and father's wedding photo, she disappeared into it and didn't return from it until her dad returned home from work. He returned to an absolutely distraught Myrthe and made her promise not to look at photos all by herself again.

During that time, to cope with her grief in her little kid way, she would repeatedly try to ring her grandmother to take her to visit her great-grandmother at the nursing home, and (albeit reluctantly), her grandmother begun to take the train to that nursing home with her so little Myrthe could cheer up. (And also because she knew that Jacomijntje would also be in a marginally better physical and mental state just by being around her.) This went from every weekend to almost every afternoon after Myrthe was done with homeschool for the day.

Myrthe went to old art galleries with Jacomijntje (her *overgrootmama*) often during these times, learning lots about the people in paintings during that time. When she was seven, she asked Jacomijntje whether or not it was "weird" to want to go into the world of a photo to spend more time with her mother. This was a question that was left unanswered even after Jacomijntje died a year later.

When Myrthe was in Year 9, her father told her that he was planning to move away from Belgium with her, and so began to teach her English the very best way he could. He told her they were moving to Australia and that she should begin gathering anything she would want to bring with her in the corner of her room.

They took the flight out of Belgium in the middle of Term 1 of 2021. She brought many old photos with her on the plane in her carry-on luggage, and when her dad got up on the plane to move around, she would often randomly "disappear", which freaked him out when he returned. He made her promise again never to do that when she was by herself, just so he didn't worry so much about her.

They moved into a house in Forrestfield, and she started at KiSS in Term 2 of that same year.

She officially is introduced to everyone else in Chapter 18.

# Relationships
## Roosje
- Myrthe initially became acquainted with [[Roosje Alderliesten]] during Chapter 14 (off-screen). They became friends in English class by trying to play a Word Chain game in Dutch. ([[Roosje Alderliesten]] won, by the way).
- They became closer in the school holidays, during which they had many sleepovers at Myrthe's place.
- In Chapter 31, Myrthe planned to confess romantic feelings for her by sharing the crab dish Roosje ordered. However, Roosje confessed first and they officially became a couple.

## Fernanda
- She and [[Fernanda Grillo]] befriended one another when they were assigned to work in a group for an assessment in Drama class off-screen during Chapter 25.
- Myrthe really likes Fernanda's fashion sense and overwhelms her with compliments, not seeming to care she wears the same thing every day.
- In a side story before the events of Chapter 31, Myrthe, Roosje, and Fernanda all go to the dinner dance together in Myrthe's dad's car. Myrthe promises to teach her a "way cool" dance move.

## Altair
- She was introduced to [[Altair Vilar-Castelo]] upon him bringing Fernanda to her Drama class from the Art block.
- They are just acquaintances at the moment.

## Vake (Robrecht)
- She is really close with her dad.
- She really likes it when he makes spicy curries for her and has a high spice tolerance because of it.
- She watches old Flemish soap operas with him on Saturday afternoons.

## Fiadh
- She met Fiadh during Chapter 18 whilst styling Roosje's hair.
- Fiadh helped her find a hair-dryer.
- She and Fiadh are similarly energetic, and she likes to try hanging out with her during rehearsals for the Production.

## Zelda
- She likes Zelda.
- She wants to get to know her a bit better.

## Alice
- She praises Alice's dress in Chapter 31 out of nervousness due to overthinking, however, she does genuinely like Alice's dress.
- She wants to go shopping with her sometime.

## Ash
- Ash actually scares her a little bit.
- She does like the sort of music he plays on his guitar, though, and will be close behind Harper to watch him play. (For different reasons, obviously.)

## Harper
- She likes Harper.
- The two share a mutual fascination for Ash's guitar skills, except Myrthe makes it clear to Harper from day one that they are not rivals and that they look up to Ash for drastically different reasons.

## Sheila
- Their dads work at the same Bunnings, so when she gets the chance, she likes to compare the stories the two's dads give them about their work days.
- She sometimes likes to note down the slang Sheila uses, but never uses it herself.
- She gets along decently with Sheila. (After all, she is one of her best friends' besties, so she can't be terrible.)

# Other
-  Speaks like a stereotypical 1950s American teen when she's nervous.
- Obsessed with fashion.
- She dresses (at least, for casual events) like Joan Jett.
- Her general fashion sense leans heavily on 1970s-80s aesthetics.
- She HATES wearing school uniform and has gotten at least 6 tickets within one term for uniform infringements.
- She often substitutes the Flemish word for an item when she doesn't yet know the English name of. (Like in Chapter 18.)
- She hates brushing her hair, but does it anyway because she looks tidy. By her next appearance after Chapter 18, she has officially cut her hair short and started brushing it.
- She always reminds Roosje of one of Roosje's mothers being a model for '50s fashion, much to the latter's annoyance.
