# History
Zelda was born in [[Germany]] in 2006 and lived there for most of her life. When she was young, her dad acted very badly towards her, eventually leading to her parents' divorce, which, in turn, also led to financial hardship for Zelda and her mother.

Zelda attended primary school and the start of high school (years 7-9) in [[Germany]], where she experiences significant difficulties, especially bullying.

Towards the end of 2021, Zelda and [[Gunda Appel|her mum]] moved to Australia, using the last of the money that [[Gunda Appel|her mum]] had been saving for a very, very long time. In Australia, Zelda began to attend [[Kalamunda Sapling School]].
## Current Day

Zelda is now studying at [[Kalamunda Sapling School]], where she takes:
- French
- English
- Biology
- Geography
- Drama
At [[Kalamunda Sapling School]], her life has improved significantly, compared to her life in Germany.

## Red-Haired Girl
Zelda met [the red-haired girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md) in [Chapter 0](Chapter%200.md 0>) of Chasing Hearts Part One. She saw her for a lunchtime period of a day in year nine, then never saw her again since. She still thinks about her constantly and hopes that she'll get to see her again one day.

## Fiadh
Zelda met [Fiadh](<Fiadh Gallagher>) in Chapter 4, on her first day at Kalamunda Sapling School. Fiadh was incredibly excited to meet her.

On Zelda's birthday in 2022, Fiadh confessed to Zelda, and from this point forward, they were not just friends, but girlfriends.
