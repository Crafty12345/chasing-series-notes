# History
She was born in Urk to her two mums, however only one (the one who had given birth, Petra) was with her at the time. Petra did not have her wife there to visit her at the same time as she had a modelling shoot that day which she couldn't reschedule. Instead, Constantijn took Petra to the hospital in Urk, and waited outside the hospital with Marjolijn for Roosje to be born.

For the rest of her time in the Netherlands, Roosje grew up in Swifterbant and Petra worked part-time so that she could pick her and Marjolijn up from school when they needed to be picked up. Petra was a relatively good mother and cared deeply for her daughters, however was often sarcastic in speech, leading her to conflict a lot with their other mother, the strait-laced, proper Truus. 

One night, Truus had taken Petra out to dinner (it was a work function and she was told she could bring a plus one). Roosje and Marjolijn that night were sent to stay with Truus' parents, who spent the entire time they were there complaining about Petra, causing them to not enjoy their time there. Not only that, but they did not have a ramp for Roosje, which meant the only way they could enter the house was through stairs and Marjolijn having to carry her in.

They wound up staying for a few weeks as Petra and Truus went around the Netherlands and even parts of Denmark for Truus' modelling shoots. This left their daughters feeling neglected and forgotten and Marjolijn, upon deciding what track she wanted to go down for the rest of her high school years, was annoyed and looked up countries overseas they could go live in/that she could study in at their local internet cafe. When their mums returned from their trip (Petra's mum had taken them into Schiphol so they could greet them on their way in), Marljolijn announced that "the minute she is old enough, she will move to Australia and leave this place behind". This disheartened both their mothers, as they actually did care for their girls, though Truus didn't often show this.

Marjolijn established that, that way, she and Roosje would never be forgotten about, and when they did move, they would at least have one another. This was enough for Marjolijn to continue researching ways they could get to Australia, and immediately she applied for a job so she could afford the airfare with her own merit.

Meanwhile, Roosje had been feeling a little alone, because she didn't really have any friends (because she was too nervous to make any, and she hated that the friends she did make only really wanted to know her because Truus was a model). This lead her to, throughout her final years in the Netherlands, hide away at school and only talk to the teachers that she knew had no interest in fashion, as they were the only ones who wouldn't constantly show her photos of her *moeder*'s frequent modelling shoots. This was what lead her to be convinced when Marjolijn eventually saved up enough for the two of them to fly over to Australia to start their new lives, as she thought that, since their *Moeder* was only a celebrity to vintage-fashion-obsessed Dutch and Danish people, nobody would talk to her about Truus anymore and she could finally be her own person.

Marjolijn instantly leapt at the chance when she noticed there was a small apartment in Kalamunda that she could rent out cheaply, and continued her university study in the Perth CBD. During this time (which was when Roosje would've been in Year 9), Roosje began learning at [Kalamunda Sapling School](Kalamunda%20Sapling%20School), very hopeful that it would help her make new, genuine friends easily. However, she found it tricky to make friends and found herself isolated for a different reason. She often found herself sitting alone at lunchtime, since nobody at school seemed to want to genuinely befriend her.

During this time, Roosje met a Danish girl named Astrid, and the two became "friends" for a little while. Astrid seemed nice and often helped Roosje out when she needed it, but seemed to only do this for selfish reasons (which Roosje was wise to due to the "friendship" she experienced in Swifterbant) but she decided to give Astrid the benefit of the doubt. What frustrated Roosje, really, is when she asked Astrid whether they could sit together at recess or lunch, Astrid would either shrug her shoulders, say "We'll see" or "If that's what you want", however never followed through on this. Whenever Roosje did decide to try to sit with her, Astrid was "just waiting for other friends" and would abandon Roosje whilst she hurried off to the canteen to hang out with the people she usually hung around with. Eventually, Roosje began to distrust Astrid but tried not to show it, as Astrid seemed genuinely nice in their Humanities lessons together.

During Harmony Week in 2022, Astrid began to show her true colours a bit more, and passed her a note during an Integrated Science lesson, causing Roosje to burst into tears and ring Fiorenza to pick her up from school early whilst her teacher comforted her. Due to this, she acted a bit crabby during her Friday Drama lesson in Chapter 20, not leading to an amazing first impression for her first proper group of friends. She was annoyed at Astrid and so was taking it out on *Mevrouw* Hummel. After eating some of her favourite food, *maatjesharing*, she calmed down drastically and apologised to her by way of complimenting the way the herring tasted. This reduced *Mevrouw* Hummel to happy tears and caused her to forgive Roosje rather quickly.

Later in the lesson, about ten minutes before it was due to end, she asked [Fiadh](Fiadh%20Gallagher) and [Zelda](Zelda%20Appel) if she could be friends with them (as she had promised Fiorenza she would do that the week before), which they agreed to.
