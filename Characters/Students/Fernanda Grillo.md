# History
She lived in Sicily until she was about ten years old. Her siblings were born when she was five and seven respectively.

Her family was not very well off, and struggled a lot to get by in those circumstances. Her father and mother worked low-paying jobs, and were overall not very satisfied with their lives there.  They then moved to Milan and lived there for two and a half years with Fernanda's *Nonnita* (Elvia).

However, they were not very successful in Milan either, her parents struggling to be able to afford sending all of their children to school. This caused Elvia to also try to find a job herself so she could help support them, so they eventually moved to Venice, where they spent the rest of that time before they decided they would move overseas.

Eventually it became too stressful for them to switch from job to job, and their children complained that it was hard for them to make friends when they kept moving around Italy. When Fernanda's *Madre* (Giuilia) was laid off from her job, she decided she'd had enough and decided she'd look for countries they could live in with a similar enough climate to where they originally lived, Sicily. Eventually, she came up with the idea of moving to Australia and immediately she and her family would be much happier and perhaps be better off if they lived there. She immediately started making plans for them to move there, feeling driven to find anywhere else to live.

She immediately applied for a job in Northbridge (which she quit whilst she was waiting at baggage claim at Perth Airport) and started to tell her family that they should be preparing to move there. Fernanda was initially annoyed about the move, because she had just gotten used to living in Rome, and didn't get her stuff ready or packed until four hours before the plane was due to board. Her *Nonnita* helped her pack her bags and promised her that Giuilia had tried to get her a seat where she would be sat between her two beloved little sisters (Velia and Venera), which cheered her up a fair bit. Somehow they wound up on the flight on time.

They arrived on a sweltering 40 degree December day, and the heat overwhelmed Fernanda so much that she had a meltdown as they were waiting outside the airport for their taxi. 

Her mother, whilst in the taxi, began to apply for a different job, this time one that had recently decided to move its management to Kalamunda, which she decided was a good idea since that was where they were moving. A few weeks into that school year, she had an interview for the job and she got it. Similarly, her *Padre* (Alonzo) also applied for a job and got one at a hotel (Memory Lane). Fernanda and Elio begin to learn at [Kalamunda Sapling School](Kalamunda%20Sapling%20School) in Term 3 of 2022. Their little sisters, the twins (Velia and Venera) begin learning at a primary school nearby.

By the time Fernanda meets the group in Chapter 25, she has not yet gotten used to the fact that the seasons are different in Kalamunda than they are in Sicily, and it takes her a long time to finally adjust to the new hemisphere and school environment she's in. Her *Nonnita* sews the clothes that Fernanda wears on non-uniform days, and helps her out by making her do up a planner so she knows exactly what she needs for each day, having a list of all the days of the week and marking off which are her uniform days. She and Alonzo (Fernanda's *Padre*) are the ones that help her with her homework when she struggles with it. Apart from the temperature changes and the classroom changing between classes, Fernanda actually is really enjoying her time at [Kalamunda Sapling School](Kalamunda%20Sapling%20School) and is happy because she has her first group of friends that she's had since she lived in *Sicilia* (which is now a while ago).
