- Ex-husband of [Gunda Appel](Gunda%20Appel.md)
- Real name: Apollo
- Is currently a ghost
- Plans to escape either himself (or someone else, I haven't decided on that bit yet) from hell, using [[Red-Haired Girl]]'s powers
- Brandt/Apollo doesn't believe in right and wrong. He strongly dislikes that the Afterlife judges are able to just seemingly arbitrarily decide who goes to the Upper Afterlife and who goes to the Lower Afterlife.
