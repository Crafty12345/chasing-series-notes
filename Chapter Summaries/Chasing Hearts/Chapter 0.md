# Chapter Summary
[Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) goes to school just like any other day, and gets bullied by the same group of boys that bully her every other day. When [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) falls over and drops her books, someone she doesn't remember ever seeing appears to help her. [The red-haired girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md) appears to help her pick her books up, and [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) feels an instant connection with her.

[Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) spends her lunch time with [the red-haired girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md), and, when the bell goes, they agree to meet after class. However, when [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) visits the place that they agreed to meet each other, she wasn't there. Assuming she simply went home sick, [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) decided to go hold on to the hope that she would be there the next day.

The next day, the boys who would usually bully her, and the ones who [the red-haired girl](Red-Haired%20Girl.md) saved her from, came back.

Things continued like this for the next few weeks, [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) slowly starting to lose hope that she'd see her again. [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) erupted into a meltdown, so much so that she visited her Void dimension, a place of emptiness, representative of her emotions at the time.
