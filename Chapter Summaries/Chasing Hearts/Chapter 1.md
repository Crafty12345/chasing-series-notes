# Chapter Summary
A year passes since [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) last saw [[Red-Haired Girl|the red-haired girl]], and she is feeling incredibly depressed. When [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) arrives home to notice [her mum](<Gunda Appel>) waiting for her to arrive, she is very shocked.

[Gunda](<Gunda Appel>) makes the announcement that she and [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) are moving to Australia. [Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) is shocked that her mother is able to afford to move to another country, however [Gunda](<Gunda Appel>) explains that she'd been saving for a very long time.

[Zelda](<Zelda Appel>) and [Gunda](<Gunda Appel>) began packing what little possessions they did have, and, the next day, the two of them took the plane to Australia, both of them hoping that their life in Australia would be better than the life they were currently used to.
